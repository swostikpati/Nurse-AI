    "1": "Presenting problem: \n A 43-year-old white man presents to a genitourinary medicine clinic with a 10-day history of constipation painful defecation, streaking of the stools with slime, a feeling of incomplete emptying of his bowels, and the passage of blood anally to a degree that it splashes in the toilet pan. His health is otherwise good, and he has not had previous bowel problems. At the age of 35 years, he had acute hepatitis B, and 3 years before the current illness he was treated for urethral gonorrhea and giardiasis. Otherwise, he has had no significant illnesses in the past. He has never been tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. His most recent sexual contact was 3 weeks previously at a party in Amsterdam, when he had unprotected receptive anal intercourse with an unknown male. \nExamination:\nThe patient looks well and is apyrexial. There is no abdominal tenderness or guarding, and no masses are felt; neither liver nor spleen is palpable. The perianal region appears normal with no ulceration. At sigmoidoscopy, the rectal mucosa is markedly edematous and friable, with mucous in the lumen. These inflammatory changes extend to about 12cm from dentate line, the more proximal mucosa appearing normal. Two ulcers, each about 1.5cm in diameter, are noted within the inflamed mucosa.\nFurther investigation:\nA nucleic acid amplification test for C. trachomatis is positive, and genotyping shows infection with the LGV serovar, clinching the diagnosis of LGV proctitis. Negative culture and a negative nucleix aid amplification rest for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA exclude concurrent infection with these organisms. A PCR for Treponema pallidum on a specimen taken from the ulcerated areas of the rectum, and syphilis serology, including an anti-treponemal IgM test to detect early infection, are negative. To exclude incubating syphilis, however, it would be necessary to repeat serological tests 1 or 3 months later.\nRectal biopsy is not likely to be helpful, as the histological changes associated with these infections are non-specific. The granulomatous changes found in LGV proctitis closely resemble those of Crohn's disease.\nSerological tests show that this patient is infected with HIV. He is only moderately immunocompromised, with a CD4+ T-cell count of 387/mm3 (normal range 500-1500/mm3). Plasma hepatitis C virus is negative; to exclude infection acquired at the same time as LGV, however, serology should be repeated in 2 and 6 months' time.\nHow to treat:\nAs the proctitis is severe, treatment should not be withheld until laboratory test results are available. The most likely diagnosis from the history and examination is LGV proctitis, and doxycycline in an oral dosage of 100 mg 12-hourly for 3 weeks should be prescribed. Aciclovir, given orally in a dose of 200 mg five times per day for 5 days, should also be prescribed to treat possible HSV infection (while awaiting the results of the microbiological tests). As multiple rectal infections, including gonorrhoea, are common in MSM, it also seems prudent to treat this man with a single intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone (500 mg). He will require counselling regarding the new diagnosis of HIV and will clearly need long-term follow-up. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is discussed but is declined by the patient.",
    "2": "Presenting Problem: \n A previously well 35-year-old single white male resident in the UK is admitted with a 3-week history of fevers, sweats and pain on swallowing. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 month previously, following presentation with weight loss and chronic frequent watery diarrhoea. At that time, his CD4 count was found to be 24 cells/mm3 and viral load >1 million copies/mL: a viral resistance test subsequently showed wild-type virus. He denied any history of travel outside Europe. Antiretroviral (ARV) combination therapy with lopinavir/ ritonavir (Kaletra), tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) was started and he is tolerating this well. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia was also commenced, but had to be discontinued because of a hypersensitivity rash and dapsone was substituted.\n Examination: \nThe patient is febrile, but comfortable at rest. He is wasted, with lesions that resemble cutaneous and oral KS; he also has perianal herpes simplex and severe oropharyngeal candidiasis. He has two-finger breadth hepatosplenomegaly but no abdominal tenderness; rectal examination reveals an empty rectum. There is no lymphadenopathy and no localising signs for his infection. Dilated fundoscopy demonstrates no evidence of retinitis. \n Further Investigation: \n Blood and stool cultures at 48 hours are negative. The patient's CD4 count is 32 cells/mm3 and viral load 1200 copies/mL. Cryptococcal antigen and treponemal antibody blood tests are negative, as is the CMV PCR. Induced sputa are negative on direct examination for Pneumocystis jirovecii and acidfast bacilli, and there is no growth on standard culture. A chest X-ray is normal, but a computed tomogram (CT) of the chest reveals numerous enlarged lymph nodes 2-5 cm in diameter in the mediastinum. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrates oesophageal candidiasis and gastric KS. \n Treatment: \n While awaiting identification of the species, it is important to consider choosing a combination of drugs that provides treatment for both mycobacterial species. It is also necessary to examine potential drug interactions with his antiretroviral agents. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 complex and rifampicin a potent inducer. Because of this, rifampicin should not be prescribed with protease inhibitors and rifabutin, which has equal potency to rifampicin against M. tuberculosis but is also active against MAI, is the drug of choice. An alternative strategy, because his viral strain is fully sensitive to ARVs, is to switch him to efavirenz maintaining the TDF/FTC and give rifampicin. Pyrazinamide and isoniazid, although first-line anti-TB drugs, have no significant activity in clinical disease associated with MAI, whereas ethambutol and certain quinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) have proven activity against both mycobacteria. Lastly, both azithromycin and clarithromycin have activity against MAI and one should be included. Hence, although several combinations are possible, a suitable one would include rifabutin, azithromycin, ethambutol, ciprofloxacin and pyrazinamide. Treatment can then be modified when identification is established (dropping pyrazinamide if MAI is confirmed and switching to standard four-drug therapy if it is M. tuberculosis). His culture PCR confirms MAI, which is successfully treated, as is his KS, which is treated with cyclical liposomal doxorubicin. The oesophageal candidiasis is successfully treated with a 14-day course of fluconazole.",
    "3": "Presenting Problem: \n A 32-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with profuse sweating and agitation. He had started antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine and lopinavir/ritonavir) for HIV infection 2 days ago. He had no symptoms related to HIV infection and a moderately impaired CD4 lymphocyte count of 317 cells/µL. He has depression, which is well controlled on fluoxetine 40 mg daily that he has been taking for several years.\n Examination: \n Finger-prick glucose was normal. He is agitated and sweating profusely. His blood pressure is 174/106 mmHg, pulse 116/min and temperature 37.8°C. No focus of infection is apparent. Generalised hyperreflexia with clonus, dilated pupils and intermittent tremor are noted on neurological examination. \n Further Investigation: \n Results of blood and urine tests are shown as Peripheral blood counts, Thyroid function tests, Urea and electrolytes are Normal; Urine for amphetamines and cocaine is negative. \n Treatment: \n He was admitted to hospital. Fluoxetine and the antiretroviral drugs were withdrawn. Diazepam was administered for the agitation and to reduce muscle activity. His symptoms and signs gradually settled over 48 h and he was discharged. A week later, a low dose of fluoxetine was started and the antiretroviral therapy recommenced without further incident. \n General supportive care is important in the serotonin syndrome, especially cooling by evaporation if hyperthermia is present. Serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine or the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine should be used in severe disease. Fluctuations in blood pressure due to autonomic instability may be difficult to manage. Severe hypertension can be managed with short-acting β-blockers.",
    "4": "Presenting Problem: \n A 30-year-old farmer is brought to an Emergency Department in Delhi on a hot July afternoon with a high-grade fever and altered conscious level. He was found in a disoriented state by co-workers in the field. His wife reports that he is normally very fit and well, but that he has had a very high temperature for the past 8 days and was febrile when he went out to work this morning. She gives no history of severe headache, loss of consciousness or seizures. \n Examination: \n The patient's rectal temperature is recorded to be 40°C and his skin is hot and dry. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 7, but there is no meningism and no focal neurological signs. Pulse rate is 120/min and blood pressure is 94/52 mmHg. The spleen is palpable 2 cm below the costal margin. The rest of the examination is normal. \nThe patient's clothes are removed, his entire body is sprayed with water in front of a fan and ice packs are applied. After a venous blood sample is taken, intravenous fluids are started. With this treatment, the patient's temperature normalises in 45 min, but there is only mild improvement in his conscious level (GCS 10). \n Further Investigation: \n Initial blood test results are shown in \n{Haemoglobin: 70 g/L, WCC: 16.4 x 109/L, Platelets: 167 x 109/L, Urea: 36 mmol/L, Creatinine: 120 µmol/L, Glucose: 4.5 mmol/L, Bilirubin: 34.2 µmol/L, AST (SGOT): 75 U/L, ALT (SGPT): 92 U/L, Alkaline phosphatase: 200 U/L}. \n Blood cultures and a Widal test are negative. Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination are normal. CSF testing for Japanese B encephalitis virus is negative. Thick and thin peripheral blood smears show high levels (>5% infected red blood cells) of ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum. \n Treatment: \n As cerebral malaria is associated with significant mortality and persistent neurocognitive impairments in survivors (especially children), it is a medical emergency and requires careful and urgent management with parenteral antimalarial therapy. The airway should be maintained, dehydration should be corrected with intravenous fluids and the patient should be nursed on his side. Intravenous artesunate should be commenced: artesunate should be given as 2.4 mg/kg i.v. at 0, 12 and 24 hours and then once daily for 7 days. However, as soon as the patient has recovered sufficiently to swallow tablets, oral artesunate 2 mg/kg once daily is given instead of i.v. therapy, to complete a total cumulative dose of 17-18 mg/kg. Hypoglycaemia is an important and serious complication of cerebral malaria and occurs as a result of malaria itself or its treatment with quinine. This complication is more common in children and pregnant women. Since artesunate is contraindicated in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, quinine should be used and is given as an intravenous infusion over 4 h. Treatment should be started with a loading dose infusion of 20 mg/kg quinine salt - up to a maximum of 1.4 g quinine can be given over 4 h. Then every 8-12 h, a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg quinine salt is given (up to a maximum of 700 mg/dose), until the patient can take drugs orally. Once the patient is able to take oral medication, mefloquine 25 mg/kg (total dose) should be added. Alternatively, doxycycline 100 mg daily could be administered for 7 days. Clindamycin should be substituted for doxycycline during pregnancy. Fresh blood should be transfused if the patient has a severe anaemia. Blood pressure, urine output, blood glucose, parasite count and haematocrit should all be monitored regularly so that other complications of severe falciparum malaria (hypoglycaemia, severe anaemia, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, peripheral circulatory failure and shock) can be detected and managed early.",
    "5": "Presenting Problem: \n A 74-year-old woman presents with anorexia and weight loss of 15 kg over the preceding 3 months. There is no history of fever or diarrhoea. She is an otherwise healthy woman who has never visited a hospital until the present episode of ill-health. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and is not taking any medication. \n Examination: \n Physical examination reveals a frail, pale-looking, emaciated elderly woman whose body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) is 13. She is well-oriented in time, place and person, and her mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score is 26. She can clearly understand her problem and is worried as to why she is losing weight. There is no evidence of peripheral lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Pelvic examination is normal. The rest of the physical examination is also unremarkable. \n Further Investigation: \n The following blood results are obtained: haemoglobin 72 g/L (7.2 g/ dL), a total leucocyte count of 2.8x109/L (103/mm3) and a platelet count of 90x109/L (103/mm3). Peripheral smear examination shows a normocytic normochromic picture and pancytopenia. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated (80 mm at the end of the 1st hour, Westergren method). Serum biochemistry, including electrolytes and urine examination, are normal. Urine culture is sterile. An oral glucose tolerance test rules out diabetes mellitus. Stool examination for parasites and occult blood is negative on three occasions. A tuberculin skin test (TST) with 5 tuberculin units (TU) of purified protein derivative (PPD) is negative. She is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative. The thyroid profile is within normal limits. The chest X-ray on admission is reported to be normal. Abdominal ultrasonography reveals kidneys with normal size and echo texture and no intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy or focal lesions in liver, spleen or other viscera. The patient undergoes upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy and these tests are also unremarkable. In view of the pancytopenia, trephine biopsy of the bone marrow is performed. It reveals granulomas with caseous necrosis and acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Subsequently, a fundus examination performed following mydriatic administration reveals choroidal tubercles. A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest reveals a classical miliary pattern. Lumbar puncture is also performed and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis is documented as normal. \n Treatment: \n Miliary tuberculosis is fatal if untreated and antituberculosis treatment remains the essential treatment strategy. In the absence of associated meningeal involvement, 6 months of treatment (a 2-month intensive phase with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, followed by a 4-month continuation phase with isoniazid and rifampicin) appears to be adequate. In the presence of associated tuberculosis meningitis, treatment needs to be given for at least 12 months. In view of the high frequency of associated tuberculosis meningitis in miliary tuberculosis, all patients with miliary tuberculosis should undergo a lumbar puncture so that they receive treatment of the optimum duration. The World Health Organization endorses the use of directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) therapy for all patients with tuberculosis."
