    "detail": "A 52-year-old woman presented with a 14-year history of progressive proximal muscle weakness and myalgia. She had been wheelchair-bound for the previous 10 years, with a significant loss of height since the onset of symptoms. \n\n She was previously healthy, with no family history of metabolic bone disease. Clinical examination revealed a proximal myopathy, short stature with marked kyphoscoliosis and pectus carinatum. Her admission laboratory investigations showed severe hypophosphatemia, with a serum phosphate of 0.87 mg/dL (0.28 mmol/L [reference interval 2.5–4.5 mg/dL; 0.8–1.4 mmol/L]). \n\n 25-Hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) was reduced with a normal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-OHD). Laboratory results are summarized in Table 1. Of note, the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate for glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) was 0.8 mg/dL (0.22 mmol/L [reference interval 2.0–3.4 mg/dL; 0.80–1.35 mmol/L]), suggestive of renal phosphate wasting. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) was elevated at 9207 pg/mL (reference interval 12–49 pg/mL). Despite phosphate and vitamin D replacement, the hypophosphatemia persisted."

    "detail": "A 70-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presented to an outpatient laboratory for routine venipuncture to evaluate glycemic management and cardiovascular disease risk. The patient arrived at the laboratory alert, with no apparent distress. Hemoglobin A1c (Hb A1c) testing was performed along with a lipid panel for routine screening of lipid disorders. \n\n The lipid panel results demonstrated mixed hyperlipidemia, showing increased triglycerides and decreased HDL cholesterol. The Hb A1c analysis by capillary electrophoresis (CE) on the Sebia CAPILLARYS 3 TERA instrument resulted with a flag for an atypical profile in the electropherogram and no Hb A1c value was reported. Prior Hb A1c measurements throughout the past year demonstrated Hb A1c concentrations ≥6.5%, consistent with his diagnosis of T2DM, and revealed a downward trend in the Hb A1c concentration. \n\n The patient was not receiving medical treatment or medications known to affect red blood cells or Hb A1c measurement. The inconclusive Hb A1c result was repeated with a different instrument and another sample from the patient, collected at a different phlebotomy location, showed similar inconclusive results as the previous specimen. \n\n Compared to typical hemoglobin and Hb A1c migration patterns, this patient’s specimens resulted in unusual shifts in hemoglobin peak migration times as observed upon close review of the electropherogram, suggesting a potential analytical interference of the Hb A1c measurement."

    "detail": "A 72-year-old female presented to the hospital with a 2-month history of poor oral intake and lethargy. \n\nThere was no history of vomiting or diarrhea, and she was not on any medications. On admission, she had a body temperature of 37.2°C, blood pressure of 110/73 mmHg, pulse rate of 111/minute, respiratory rate of 19/minute and oxygen saturation (Carescape V100, GE Healthcare) under room air was 98%.\n\nAn electrocardiogram showed no conduction abnormality. Cardiovascular and respiratory systems were unremarkable, and abdominal examination did not reveal hepatosplenomegaly. She had no muscle weakness. Blood investigations revealed hyperleukocytosis with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and severe hypokalemia. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia with the presence of 93% blasts. \n\nOther abnormal blood results include hyperuricemia, raised lactate dehydrogenase, raised creatinine, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia. She was started on intravenous potassium replacement (40 mmol over 24 hours, Injecsol K10; Ain Medicare Sdn. Bhd.) given in 1000 mL 0.9% NaCl and oral hydroxyurea (500 g stat and 1 g once daily, DHNP Hydroxyurea®; Dae Han New Pharm). \n\nThe serum potassium concentration obtained 24 hours later following treatment had worsened. A repeated blood sample with a shorter time interval between blood collection and analysis [blood collected in a blood gas syringe, placed on ice, and immediately analyzed on a point-of-care (POC) blood gas analyzer (ABL90 Flex analyzer, Radiometer)], had a higher potassium level of 2.9 mmol/L."

    "detail": "A 61-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department (ED) with ecchymoses and edema of his left forearm and elbow after mild trauma from bumping into a table during the previous evening. \n\nPast medical history revealed hypertension, severe gout on colchicine, and negative family and medical history of bleeding or thrombosis. His history was negative for anticoagulants and other medications. \n\nToxicology screens were negative. The patient’s hemoglobin (Hb) was 14.3 g/dL (reference interval: 12.0–16.0 g/dL), platelet count (PLT) of 234 k/μL (reference interval: 150–450 k/μL), prothrombin time (PT) of 13.0 s (reference interval: 11.8–14.8 g/dL), and a marked prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 70.5 s (reference interval: 23.3–38.6 s). \n\nThe patient was otherwise stable and referred to outpatient hematology to work-up a potential coagulation disorder. However, he was unable to secure hematology follow-up."

    "detail": "A 75-year-old retired engineer presented with a 2-year history of progressive difficulty recalling conversations and events. Over the past year, he stopped paying bills, managing medications, or driving. \n\nSix months ago, he experienced a sudden increase in agitation and aggression. He began to leave his home unaccompanied, becoming lost in his own neighborhood, requiring fulltime supervision and assistance with activities of daily living. Past medical history was notable for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia that were well-controlled with lisinopril and simvastatin. \n\nThere was no history of tobacco or alcohol use, or family history of dementia or autoimmunity. Review of systems confirmed unintentional 10-pound weight loss. General physical examination was normal, including vital signs. Neurological examination was notable for poor naming, and an inability to follow multistep commands. \n\nBedside cognitive testing confirmed global cognitive impairment (Mini Mental Status Examination = 8), with prominent deficits in delayed verbal recall. The patient was diagnosed with moderate-severity dementia with behavioral disturbance at an outside institution. \n\nGiven the history of accelerated decline associated with weight loss, serum tests for antibodies associated with neurological disease (Mayo Clinic Paraneoplastic Panel) were ordered, identifying low, but abnormal, concentrations of P/Q voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) autoantibodies (0.06 nmol/L [reference interval ≤ 0.02 nmol/L]), and prompting further evaluation."
